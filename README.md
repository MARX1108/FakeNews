## Overview
You need to implement at least **two** machine learning algorithms to solve the problem, report their performance and analyze their results

You are not allowed to directly copy code from online or others. You are not allowed to use machine learning packages, e.g., Scikit-Learn. You can use Pytorch or Tensorflow if you use Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc.

## Deliverables
1. The **first deliverable** will be the programs you have implemented:
	* the source code as well as the data you used to train and test the models
	* the **optimized parameters/models** you have learned
	* a README file to explain how to step-by-step train and test the models
2. The **second deliverable** will be a final report, which should be **at least two pages** long in a reasonable format. You should use at least 10-point font in a standard typeface such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Helvetica. It should discuss:
	* what the problem is and why it’s important
	* what algorithms you used to solve the problem and details of how the algorithms work
	* the experimental results, including deta iled performance, e.g., **Precision, Recall, F-score, detailed discussion and analysis of the results,** e.g., remaining errors, advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm you observed, how to further improve them, etc. 
	* describe the role of each team member within the project
3. The **final deliverable** is a final project presentation, which should cover all the content you discuss in the final report. 

## Data
	* **title**: the title of a news article
	* **text**: the text of the article
	* **subject**: the subject of the news article
	* **date**: the published date of the article
	* **label**: a label that marks the article as fake or real
		* fake
		* real
